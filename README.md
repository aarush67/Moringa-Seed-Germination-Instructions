### Materials Needed

- Moringa seeds
- Water
- Paper towels
- Small plastic bag or container
- Hydrogen Peroxide (Optional)
- Cup

### Instructions

1. **Seed Selection**: Choose fresh, mature Moringa seeds that are dark brown in color. Discard any cracked or damaged seeds.
2. **Pre-soak the Seeds**: Prepare the water and add around 3 drops of hydrogen peroxide to a cup of water. Soak the seeds in this water overnight to soften the outer shell.
3. **Prepare for Germination**: Wrap the seeds in a damp paper towel. Place the wrapped seeds inside a plastic bag or container.
4. **Germination**: Keep the container in a warm, dark place (70-85Â°F). After a couple of days, you will see a white root coming from the seed. At this point, you can plant the seed in soil.
